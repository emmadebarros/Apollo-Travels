# ðŸš€ Apollo Travels - PHP Final Project ðŸš€
# Description

This is the final source code for the final PHP/SQL project that was created for the purpose of the PHP Programming course, with professor [Gregory Prokopski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prokopski/) ðŸ”—.

In this course, we learned about the syntax and control structures of PHP language, as well as its web-context-specific features.

For the project, we used the PHP language and external libraries to implement web pages using the MVC principles, with a micro-framework, database access library, and templating library.

This project highlighted and improved my knowledge of API's, AJAX calls and industry level software design ðŸŽ¨.

**Please note** that, due to the really short length of the PHP Programming class (2 weeks and a half, approximately), not all features are fully implemented and the use of CSS don't respect the industry standards.
